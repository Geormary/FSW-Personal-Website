            <h1>Harlem is what I am Repping.</h1>
            <p>
              As a software engineer (FSW), I love having the opportunity to
              create and build new worlds for my community and myself. My
              participation in Pursuit, an intensive 12-month, software
              engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate, has given me the
              experience to hone my skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node,
              Express, React.js, Redux.js, PostgreSQL, APIs, sprints, pair
              programming, and code reviews, Git and Github.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am pursuing software engineering because it gives me the
              opportunity to innovate and create in ways that can have positive
              impact. As a Black Latina woman born and raised in Harlem,
              learning how to use technology to create, innovate, and grow is a
              freeing and empowering experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              I get inspired every time I am exposed to new experiences and
              ideas, knowing that like my mother, I can get things done. I would
              love to push the world to be bigger and think bigger. I feel this
              comes with limiting ignorance, and increasing exposure to inspire
              community and creation. Using my abilities to solve problems as
              well as gauging the strengths of people and situations, I aim to
              listen before I speak and allow space for others because I want to
              absorb and learn from people I interact with.
            </p>

            <p>
              Learning and advancement are my passions, outside of coding I like
              to create artistically and observe the world through the eyes of
              astrology.
